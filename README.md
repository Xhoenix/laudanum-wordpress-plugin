# Laudanum WordPress Plugin

```
/**
 * Plugin Name: Laudanum
 * Description: This plugin is leveraged for running security tests and should be left disabled when not in use.
 * Author: Jason Gillam and the Laudanum Team
 * Version: 0.03

```


The original Laudanum WordPress Plugin provided in [Laudanum Project](https://sourceforge.net/projects/laudanum/) has not been updated for many years and no longer works with latest **PHP**. I made a few changes and now it supports Latest WordPress running on **PHP 8.1**. As described above, this plugin is meant for running security tests and should be *removed* when not in use, as it can provide an attacker privilege to execute code on the underlying server. **Use it at your own risk!**


>**Note:-** This plugin comes with a simple protection mechanism to prevent **Script Kiddies** from running it on a **live** server. If you want to run it on a live server, then refer the files and make modifications as necessary.
